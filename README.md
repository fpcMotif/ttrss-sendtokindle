Tiny Tiny RSS Plugin to send articles to your kindle in one click

To use this plugin you have to configure your kindle mail address in your Tiny Tiny RSS Acccoung Settings page at "Personal Settings".
At your "My kindle" site of Amazon (e.g. amazon.com/myk or amazon.de/myk) you must allow sending documents to your kindle for the address 'kindle@darkhelmetlive.com' because the plugin uses the service of http://tinderizer.com/.
